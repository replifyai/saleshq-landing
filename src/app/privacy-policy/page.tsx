            <p>
              If you are a data subject from the UK or European Economic Area, SalesHQ's legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which SalesHQ collects it.
            </p>

            <p>
              SalesHQ will normally collect Personal Data from you only where it needs it to perform a contract with you, where the processing is in SalesHQ's legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where SalesHQ has your consent. In some cases, SalesHQ may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you. If SalesHQ processes Personal Data with reliance on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.
            </p>
